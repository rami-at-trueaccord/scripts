# scripts

Not the best. Not the worst. Probably all python. Maybe not. Idk.

## Goal

Use this as a reminder/refresher/pensieve; whatever you want to call it. It's setup to (hopefully) work as it's own project, but the goal is to really just remember stuff.

Nothing here should contain anything private. Just general scripts.

Use pipx to install virtualenv
`virtualenv venv`

Start the virtual environment
`source ./venv/bin/activate`

Install the requirements
`pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
